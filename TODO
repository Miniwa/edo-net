64bit proof application:
    Win32Process needs to handle different pointer sizes (Create IBinarySerializer interface and make 32bit/64bit implementations)
    Complete type check of all native imports to see they're handled properly
    Split bytecode into 32 and 64 bit versions

Win32Process should be able to start threads
Win32Process should be able to suspend, resume, kill and start new processes
SystemHandle should check if process handle in "TargetsProcess"
SystemHandle should be able to duplicate any handle, not just process handles
Make DuplicateHandle able to duplicate any handle, not just process handles (The api is a bit weird right now)
Implement stream methods in Seriz module
Create framework specific exception types to catch Win32Exceptions with native error message
